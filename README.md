# pdpm

pdpm.py converts a Pandoc (<http://pandoc.org>) input file to PDF,
HTML, or HTML slides based on DZSlides (<http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/>).
Pygments (<http://pygments.org/>) is used to highlight code blocks.

I use this for teaching courses in Python, Processing
(<https://processing.org/>), Java and C.  So I have a Pygments style
designed to match the colors used in IDLE and a Pygments lexer for
Processing, which is Pygments' Java lexer, but modified to include
Processing's built-in global varibles, functions and constants.
